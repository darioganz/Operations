# Onboarding Bot to communicate with the New Students during their Integration to SCL

This Telegram bot is designed to facilitate the onboarding process for new members of the Smart Contracts Lab. It provides new joiners with essential resources and collects their details for registration purposes.
The bot increases the efficiency and automatization of the operational process of introducing new students to the project.

- **Resource Distribution**: Allows users to download the important documents such as the onboarding schedule and welcome brochure directly from the chat.
- **User Registration**: Collects user details and stores them in a CSV file for confirmation by the task force team.
- **User Confirmation**: Enables the task force team to confirm new users after reviewing their submitted details.
- **Message Forwarding**: Forwards messages from users to the group chat of the onboarding task force for direct communication and support
- **Reply Messages**: The onboarding task force can directly reply to users with a reply button via the task force group chat (/reply USER_ID MESSAGE)
- **Broadcast Messages**: Supports broadcasting messages via a button to all registered users (/broadcast MESSAGE)
